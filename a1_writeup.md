# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
    I'm not quite sure what to think about python so far. I've gotten quite used to coding in Java, ever since I took APCSA, so trying to code in a different language has been a bit difficult. For example, for the a1.py functions, we had to make for loops. I could have easily done it in Java, but had no idea how to go about it in Python. I'm excited to learn more about it and do some more coding. 


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Some similarities that I've noticed so far is that some functions need return statements. Another similarity is that there are if else statements. One of the differences that I noticed is that you dont need semi colins at the end of each line, like in Java. Another difference that I noticed is that you don't always need to specify the type of variable to be inputed. 

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

A few things that I learnt how to do through this assignment is how to write a for loop and an if statement in python.
